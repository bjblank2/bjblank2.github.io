Hello and thanks for stopping by my poster. If you scanned poster's QR code to get here its probably because I am away at the moment. I've been having some issues with my website so I apologies for the lack of content.
If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them during the poster session (I should be here the whole time) or reach out to me via email at bjblank2@illinois.edu.
